<p>FULL CHAPTER LIST</p>
<ol class="list-info-content">
<li class="list-1">
<h2><span class="colorNumber">1</span>Essentials of Responsive Design</h2>
<p>By the end of this first chapter, you will have made a responsive web page. Along the way we will get an understanding of where Responsive Web Design came from, the problems it solves and the core tenants of implementing a Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS</p>
</li>
<li class="list-2">
<h2><span class="colorNumber">2</span>Writing HTML markup</h2>
<p>Good HTML markup is the basis for any good web site or application. More importantly, HTML provides a bedrock of understanding for assistive technology. In this chapter we cover everything from the opening <!DOCTYPE html> to the closing tag.</p>
</li>
<li class="list-3">
<h2><span class="colorNumber">3</span>Media Queries & Responsive Images</h2>
<p>Media queries provide the means to target CSS not just on screen width, but screen height, color preference, screen density (DPI) and a whole lot more. Besides the media query deep-dive, this chapter also covers responsive images; allowing you to provide any number of image permutations based upon the target device.</p>
</li>
<li class="list-4">
<h2><span class="colorNumber">4</span>Layout with Flexbox</h2>
<p>Flexbox is the most widely supported modern CSS layout system. Once we have covered the syntax and use cases of Flexbox, we get our hands dirty with Flexbox; using it to layout the markup of this very site.</p>
</li>
<li class="list-5">
<h2><span class="colorNumber">5</span>Layout with Grid</h2>
<p>CSS Grid is the latest layout system. New in this edition is a whole chapter dedicated to understanding the capabilities and efficiencies of CSS Grid. Once we have an understanding we will use our new knowledge to make improvements to our existing implementation of a site design.</p>
</li>
<li class="list-6">
<h2><span class="colorNumber">6</span>CSS selectors, typography, color modes and more</h2>
<p>This is a dense and varied chapter covering topics such as how CSS selectors work, dealing with typography using @font-face and variable fonts, understanding HEX, RGBA and HSLA color modes plus a whole bunch of extra topics such as text-truncation, multi-column layout, CSS calc and environment variables. Oh and more besides. Phew!</p>
</li>
<li class="list-7">
<h2><span class="colorNumber">7</span>Create stunning aesthetics and effects with CSS</h2>
<p>Another chapter bursting with CSS goodness. Want to know about text and box shadows? What about multiple backgrounds and linear and radial gradients? Repeating gradients? CSS filters like blur and sepia? Masks and Clipping? Mix-blend modes? It's all in here. Plus we will finish off by looking at CSS scroll-snap; the fancy CSS ability to scroll elements to a specific point – no JavaScript needed!</p>
</li>
<li class="list-8">
<h2><span class="colorNumber">8</span>SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics</h2>
<p>SVGs are an essential part of a responsive developers toolkit. We cover the most practical use-cases for SVG; how to insert SVGs directly into markup, inside an object element, as a background image and standard image. We also cover creating an SVG sprite sheet, and how SVGs can be animated and optimisied for use on the web.</p>
</li>
<li class="list-9">
<h2><span class="colorNumber">9</span>Transitions, Transformations and Animations</h2>
<p>Transitions, transformations and animations, when used judiciously, can really bring a design to life. In this chapter we cover all three. Once the syntax and use-cases are covered we will use them practically to create the various transitions, transformations and animations on this site.</p>
</li>
<li class="list-10">
<h2><span class="colorNumber">10</span>Forms</h2>
<p>This chapter covers everything you are likely to need to know about forms. Topics include accessible form structure, the various elements of forms, form validation and the most recent CSS that allows better control of form visuals than ever before.</p>
</li>
<li class="list-11">
<h2><span class="colorNumber">11</span>Guidance and approaches for responsive front-end development</h2>
<p>In the final chapter we will bring together all the knowledge learned so far and consider how best to approach a responsive project. We also consider some best-practice techniques to get your responsive HTML and CSS based projects off to the best possible start</p>
