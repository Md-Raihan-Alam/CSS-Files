 we have a 450px wide image (called sconessmall.jpg) and a 900px wide image (called scones-medium.jpg). It's important to
note this w-suffixed value isn't a "real" size. It's merely an indication to the browser,
roughly equivalent to the width in "CSS pixels."


This w-suffixed value makes more sense when we factor in the sizes attribute.
The sizes attribute allows us to communicate the intentions for our images to the
browser. In our preceding example, the first value is equivalent to "for devices that
are at least 280px wide, I intend the image to be around 100vw wide.


The second part is, effectively, "Hi browser, for devices that are at least 640px
wide, I only intend the image to be shown at 50vw." That may seem a little
redundant until you factor in DPI (or DPR for device pixel ratio). For example, on
a 320px wide device with a 2x resolution (effectively requiring a 640px wide image,
if shown at full width), the browser might decide the 900px wide image is actually
a better match as it's the first option it has for an image that would be big enough
to fulfill the required size.
