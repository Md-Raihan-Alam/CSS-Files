The viewport <meta> tag is added within the <head> tags
of the HTML. It can be set to a specific width (which we could specify in pixels, for
example) or as a scale, for example, 2.0 (twice the actual size). Here's an example of
the viewport meta tag set to show the browser at twice (200 percent) the actual size:
<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=2.0,width=device-width"
/>
Let's break the preceding <meta> tag down and understand what's going on. The
name="viewport" attribute tells the browser this tag is dealing with the viewport.
The content="initial-scale=2.0 section is then saying, "scale the content to twice
the size" (where 0.5 would be half the size, 3.0 would be three times the size, and so
on), while the width=device-width part tells the browser that the width of the page
should be equal to device-width. The <meta> tag can also be used to control the
amount a user can zoom in and out of the page. This example allows users to go as
large as three times the device's width and as small as half the device's width:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, maximum-scale=3,
minimum-scale=0.5" />
You could also disable users from zooming at all:
<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"
/>
user-scalable=no is the relevant part here.
