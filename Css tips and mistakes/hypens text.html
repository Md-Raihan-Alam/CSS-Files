        <p>In CSS Text Level 3, a new property came along: hyphens. It accepts three
            values: none, manual, and auto. Its initial value is manual, to match the
            existing behavior: we could always hyphenate manually, with soft hyphens.
            Obviously, hyphens: none; would disable this behavior,</p>
