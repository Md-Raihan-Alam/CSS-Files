                    specify a cell width, they will be assigned one that depends
                    on their contents. Notice how the cell with more content
                    here is much wider.

                    calculating the widths, not

                    there’s not enough space for 3000px, they are
                    reduced proportionally, to 33.3% and 66.6%
                    of the total width.
